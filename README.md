# PlateSync #

## Introduction ##
PlateSync is a Bukkit plugin that "tethers" adjacent pressure plates together so when one is set off, any nearby plates are activated as well.

## How to Use ##
Nothing fancy. If the plugin is installed, it just works. No configuration, no permissions.

## Installation ##
PlateSync is a Bukkit plugin and is to be used on a Bukkit/Spigot server. Simply drag the plugin jar into your server's plugins folder and you are good to go. The first supported Minecraft version is 1.11.2.

## LWC Compatibility ##
PlateSync is LWC aware! LWC is registered as a soft dependency and if present will be queried about protections before executing any tethering operations.
